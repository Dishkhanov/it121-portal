       <u><h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2></u>
       
     <p> Hello everyone, my name is Daniel Ishkhanov, I am currently a 21 year old student in the YearUp program at Seattle Central College completing the Systems Development & Technology path. I have a vision for the future to build my own brand and community that helps people grow as an individual and as well as share each otherâ€™s knowledge. My leadership mentality has helped me get to where I currently am and has been able to always look ahead for the benefit of myself and the others around me. I am ready to apply all my skills to any opportunity that gets presented to me in the near future.

I am a full-time student, I am motivated by competitiveness and hunger for growth. I also am currently completing my Associates General Degree this year with the college credits attained from YearUp. I have no intention to go to a four-year but you will never know what the future holds.

      
      
      I am striving to build a foundation on my journey into the professional world into which I can hurdle any obstacle that comes my way as well.
Buiiding a community is a huge step for me because I truly believe in order to make an impact on today's world you have to start small and expand out.
    </p>
